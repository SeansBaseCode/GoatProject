        <p>Interviewer: Mr. Mango, what inspired you to create a food that soars above and beyond anything seen before?</p>
        <p>Mango: Well, when I was a young manglet, I was constantly appalled by the state of gastronomy that the world had tolerated for centuries.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until I was almost a manglor that I realized, the world needed a choice and only I could give it to them.</p>
        <p>Interviewer: Did you find success in the business at first?</p>
        <p>Mango: Naturally there were ups and downs, I'm sure you heard about the avacado scandal of [REDACTED]</p>
        <p>But despite the many casualties, we believe that the experience helped better the practice for future generations.</p>
        <p>Interviewer: Do you have any future plans for the business? What can we expect to see from MangCorpâ„¢ in the coming years?</p>
        <p>Mango: While I cannot legally disclose too much information of our coming projects, I can tell you that the innovative technology of genetic splicing created by Aperature Science has opened many doors of possibilty for us here.</p>
        <p>Interviewer: Final question, Mr. Mango. Are you not worried about the alarmingly large creature behind you right now?</p>
        <p>Mango: Don't look into its eyes.</p>
        <p>The tape ends here, further investigation is required before conclusive evidence can be found.</p>
        <p>The suspect of multiple local disappearances, known only by the pseudonym "EV", has not been located.</p>
